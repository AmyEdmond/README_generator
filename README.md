# README Generator

## Description

The goal for this challenge was to create a README generator so a professional README can be quickly created for a new project. An important component of an application is a high quality README. When the application is invoked, you are prompted to answer a series of questions about the application repository. Using this generator,  the need to create a professional README from scratch is removed and you only have to answer the questionsand it is done for you.
